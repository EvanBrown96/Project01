The game will provide players a tiled board with a number of hidden mines
and an equal number of flags which with to mark the mines.

The player has three choices of action:
- Flag: flag a tile that might have a mine
- Unflag: unflag if you think you made a mistake
- Reveal: show what a tile has hiding underneath

When you choose to reveal:
- If the square has a mine -> Gameover!
- Not a mine -> Display number of adjacent squares that DO have a mine

Goal: place a flag where all of the mines are.

Also, as an added difficulty, some or all of the mines will move
    around every time you select to reveal!

Note: To see your current time, enter 'T' when asked for coordinates;
    you can also enter 'C' to enter cheat mode!

Good Luck!
