Welcome to Minesweepers!

Here are the game instructions:

The game will provid players a square board with a number of hidden mines and similar number of flags.

Player has three choices of action:

- Flag: to flag squares that might have mines.

- Unflag: to unflag if player changed mind.

- Reveal: to see what squares have underneath.

When player chose to reveal:

- If the square has a mine -> Gameover!

- If not a mine, it will show spaces and numbers to tell player the number of mines around the chosen square.

The goal is to flag all mines until the counter of flags equals to zero without revealing any mine.

Note: To see your current time, enter 'T' when asked for coordinates, you can also enter 'C' to enter cheat mode!

Good Luck!
